# ht1632c
Arduino library for HT1632C based led dot matrix displays (eg. Sure Electronics)

This library supports original AVR Arduino as like as Leaflab Maple, ChipKIT Uno32 and maybe other Arduino clones based on ARM Cortex M3 or PIC32.

This project is cloned from [ht1632c on code.google.com](https://code.google.com/p/ht1632c/).
See [original wiki](https://code.google.com/p/ht1632c/w/list) for documentation.
